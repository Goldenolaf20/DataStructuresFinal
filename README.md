# DataStructuresFinal
This repository will be used to keep track of my progress on my Data Structures Final Project

# What problem am I trying to solve
An issue that I have routinely is keeping track of the work that I have to get done for each class each week, however, not every professor puts a detailed list of what is due each week, making it hard to keep track of what exactly is due each week. That is why having a digital tracker of what is due for what classes and when would be helpful.

# Specifics about how I deal with the problem, plus how I use 2 data structures and a sorting algorithm
The homework tracker would have a linked list of the homework for each class, as most homework assignments link to each other. As I add new assignments for a class, they will be linked as the next object of the current homework assignment. Then a queue could be created, keeping track of which due dates will come first, therefore tracking which assignments should be worked on next. The sorting system will be used to keep track of the queue, and make sure that the next due date is in order by assigning a value of the amount of days until the assingnments are due and reversing the sort, and if the days are the same, sorting then by alphabetical.

# Proposed Timeline with Sprints
Sprint 1 - 3/23/2023 - Classes created, functional driver class

Sprint 2 - 4/6/2023 - Data structures added, functional sorting

Sprint 3 -Â  4/20/2023 - GUI created, functionality, and bug fixing

Sprint 4 - Final Testing, Completed program, and polishing GUI
